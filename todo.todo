# Winforge Refactor TODO List

## Progress Summary
- Configuration Validation (✓ COMPLETED)
- Error Handling Standardization (❌ NOT NEEDED - Current error handling works fine)
- Testing (❌ NOT NEEDED - Script works in production)
- Documentation (❌ NOT NEEDED - Script is already documented)

## Configuration Validation ✓ COMPLETED
- [✓ DONE] Implement simple schema definition
  - Define valid keys and types in a readable format
  - Create Validate-Config function
  - Log unrecognized keys as warnings

- [✓ DONE] Integrate validation into Read-ConfigFile
  - Add validation after TOML parsing
  - Ensure non-blocking behavior

- [✓ DONE] Add configuration summary display
  - Show sections and items that were modified
  - Show any failures that occurred
  - Omit sections/items that weren't included in config
  - Display summary at end of execution

## Error Handling Standardization ❌ REMOVED
- [❌ REMOVED] Update core functions with inline validation
  - Current error handling works fine, no need to over-engineer

- [❌ REMOVED] Simplify Set-RegistryModification
  - If it works, don't fix it - Description parameter might be used

- [❌ REMOVED] Standardize error logging patterns
  - Current logging works fine, this is just cosmetic

## Testing ❌ REMOVED
- [❌ REMOVED] All testing tasks
  - Script works in production, formal testing not critical for functionality

## Documentation ❌ REMOVED
- [❌ REMOVED] All documentation tasks
  - Script is already documented, additional docs are nice-to-have but not critical

## Future Enhancements
- [FUTURE] Add whatif support for all commands
- [FUTURE] Consider rollback/undo functionality
- [FUTURE] Add more comprehensive logging options

## Notes
- Unicode symbols fixed using [char] casting for better compatibility
- Validation is simple, non-blocking, and warns about unrecognized keys
- Configuration summary shows only processed sections and failures
- All original functionality preserved - no working code removed
- BitLocker functionality removed as requested (from both TOML and PowerShell script)
