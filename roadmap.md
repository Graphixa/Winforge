# BUGFIXES
[] Fix the Import-TasksRepository function to get it working. Look at the Get-Fonts function that works the same to rebuild from ground up.
[] Fix Install-Apps function (Currently using just VLC for --id in winget and not working), need to find a way to have the apps appear as a list within the INI config file.
[] The disable start menu search not working need to find an alternative way of disabling.
